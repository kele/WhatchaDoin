WhatchaDoin
===========

# This is project is under WIP and has been temporarily (or permamently) abandoned.

## What **WhatchaDoin** is?

**WhatchaDoin** is an app that helps with increasing productivity by letting your coworkers/roommate/significant other know whatcha doin'.

## Ok, but __seriously__?
This app is a time tracker which lets other people know whether you are busy or not. It's as simple as that. If you say you are busy, others can check it and _hopefully_ they won't interrupt you ;-)

## How is it better than IM and Available/Busy statuses?
It does **not** provide any way to _interrupt_ you. You can only _check_ whether someone else is busy or not. No _pinging_, no sending a message, no funny cats.
